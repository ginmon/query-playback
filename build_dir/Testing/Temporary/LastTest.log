percona-playback
Version: 0.7

USAGE: percona-playback [General Options]:

General options:
  --help                                Display this message
  --version                             Display version information

Database Options:
  --db-plugin arg                       Database plugin
  --input-plugin arg                    Input plugin
  --dispatcher-plugin arg               Dispatcher plugin
  --disable-reporting-plugin arg        Disable reporting plugin
  --queue-depth arg                     Queue depth for DB executor (thread). 
                                        The larger this number the greater the 
                                        played-back workload can deviate from 
                                        the original workload as some 
                                        connections may be up to queue-depth 
                                        behind. (default 1)
  --session-init-query arg              This query will be executed just after 
                                        each connect to db

Audit Log Options:
  --audit-log-file arg                  Audit log file
  --audit-log-stdin                     Read audit log from stdin

General Log Options:
  --general-log-file arg                General log file
  --general-log-stdin                   Read general log from stdin

MySQL Client Options:
  --mysql-host arg                      Hostname of MySQL server
  --mysql-username arg                  Username to connect to MySQL
  --mysql-password arg                  Password for MySQL user
  --mysql-schema arg                    MySQL Schema to connect to
  --mysql-socket arg                    MySQL Socket to connect to when 
                                        mysql-host=localhost
  --mysql-port arg                      MySQL port number
  --mysql-max-retries arg               How often should we retry a query which
                                        returned an error
  --mysql-filter-error arg              Don't print error messages which 
                                        contain the specified regex(use ".*" to
                                        suppress all errors)
  --mysql-test-connect arg              Per default we do a test connection to 
                                        the MySQL server to check if the 
                                        connection settings are correct and 
                                        exit if it fails

Query Log Options:
  --query-log-file arg                  Query log file
  --query-log-stdin                     Read query log from stdin
  --query-log-set-timestamp             By default, we skip the SET 
                                        TIMESTAMP=XX; query that the MySQL slow
                                        query log always includes. This may 
                                        cause some subsequent queries to fail, 
                                        depending on your workload. If the 
                                        --run-set-timestamp option is enabled, 
                                        we run these queries too.
  --query-log-preserve-query-time       Ensure that each query takes at least 
                                        Query_time (from slow query log) to 
                                        execute.
  --query-log-accurate-mode             Preserves pauses between queries.
  --query-log-disable-sorting           Disables the sorting of queries based 
                                        on time (and InnoDB TRX ID). Instead 
                                        replays queries in the order they 
                                        appear in the log. Ignored in accurate 
                                        mode which always does the sorting.

Simple Report Options:
  --show-per-connection-query-count     For each connection, display the number
                                        of queries executed.
  --ignore-row-result-diffs             Ignore differences in the number of 
                                        rows returned.

Threads-pool Options:
  --thread-pool-threads-count arg (=4)  The number of threads in thread pool. 
                                        If this options is omitted the number 
                                        of threads equals to hardware 
                                        concurency.
